# 🎨 Brief Design Rationale
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Visual Design Philosophy
The app follows a clean, modern aesthetic inspired by leading fintech applications like Mint and YNAB, with careful attention to:
Minimalist Interface: Clean white backgrounds with strategic use of color
Consistent Typography: Inter font family with clear hierarchy (Regular, Medium, SemiBold, Bold)
Purposeful Color System:
🟢 Green (#10B981) for income and positive actions
🔴 Red (#EF4444) for expenses and destructive actions
🔵 Blue-gray (#6B7280) for secondary information
Micro-interactions: Subtle shadows, rounded corners, and hover states
Responsive Layout: Optimized for various screen sizes
### Information Architecture
Tab-based Navigation: Three primary sections (Dashboard, Add Transaction, All Transactions)
Progressive Disclosure: Key information first, details on demand
Visual Hierarchy: Clear distinction between primary and secondary content.

# 🎯 Usability Heuristics Implementation
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I focused on Jakob Nielsen's 10 Usability Heuristics with particular emphasis on the following:

## 1. 👁️ Visibility of System Status
Loading States: Spinner component during data fetching
Form Validation: Real-time error messages with clear feedback
Transaction Status: Visual indicators for income (green +) vs expenses (red -)
Balance Display: Prominent current balance with color coding
## 2. 🔄 Match Between System and Real World
Familiar Icons: 💼 for salary, 🍽️ for dining, 🚗 for transportation
Natural Language: "Good morning!" greeting, conversational copy
Real Currency Format: Proper dollar formatting ($1,234.56)
Logical Categories: Intuitive expense/income categorization
## 3. 🎛️ User Control and Freedom
Easy Navigation: Bottom tab bar always accessible
Delete Functionality: Swipe-to-delete with confirmation dialogs
Form Reset: Clear form after successful submission
Search & Filter: Find transactions quickly in the transactions list
## 4. 📏 Consistency and Standards
Design System: Consistent spacing (8px grid), colors, and typography
Icon Usage: Standardized icon sizes and colors throughout
Button Styles: Uniform button treatments and states
Navigation Patterns: Consistent tab bar behavior
## 5. 🚫 Error Prevention
Form Validation: Prevent invalid data entry before submission
Required Fields: Clear indication of mandatory information
Type Constraints: Numeric keyboard for amount input
Category Selection: Visual selection prevents empty submissions
## 6. 🧠 Recognition Rather Than Recall
Visual Categories: Icon-based category selection
Recent Transactions: Quick access to latest activity
Persistent Navigation: Tab bar always visible
Clear Labels: Descriptive button and field labels
## 7. 🎯 Flexibility and Efficiency of Use
Quick Add: Streamlined transaction entry flow
Search Functionality: Fast transaction lookup
Smart Defaults: Expense type pre-selected (most common)
Keyboard Optimization: Appropriate input types for each field
## 8. 🎨 Aesthetic and Minimalist Design
Clean Interface: Generous white space and clear hierarchy
Focused Content: Only essential information visible
Subtle Shadows: Depth without distraction
Color Purpose: Colors convey meaning, not just decoration
## 9. 🆘 Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors
Inline Validation: Errors appear next to relevant fields
Clear Error Messages: Specific, actionable feedback
Visual Error States: Red borders and text for invalid inputs
Confirmation Dialogs: Prevent accidental destructive actions
## 10. 📚 Help and Documentation
Intuitive Interface: Self-explanatory design reduces need for help
Placeholder Text: Guidance within form fields
Empty States: Helpful messaging when no data exists
Contextual Feedback: Success messages after actions.
